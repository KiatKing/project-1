        <h2>Watch Making &amp; Modding</h2>
        <p>My passion for building and creating manifested in my hobby of watch making. Designing and assembling a watch from scratch allows me to explore and mould my creative side.</p>
        <p>The process of watch making, to me, is a form of meditation. It is where I can de-stress, clear my mind, and only focus on the task at hand.</p>

        <h2>Rock Climbing</h2>
        <p>Often we think of work and play as antonyms, opposite ends of life’s spectrum. Play, however, can become the key to training your mind to problem-solve more effectively. It’s no coincidence that my problem-solving skills have sharpen and improved since rock climbing became a part of my routine over the past 2 years.</p>  
        <p>Rock Climbing problems (yes, they’re literally called problems) force me to think creatively about how I need to sequence my moves. I’ve learned to go back to the drawing board as soon as I fall off the wall, rather than trying the same failed method twice.</p>
